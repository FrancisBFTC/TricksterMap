# TricksterMap

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/0vc5mwjjxs026985/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Raymonf/trickstermap/branch/master)

**[Compiled binaries are available on AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Raymonf/trickstermap/build/artifacts)**

## Introduction

This is a project written in C# whose end goal is to be able to read and write map data files for a game called Trickster Online. The project was designed with at least partial localization support in mind, and an example (low-quality) Chinese localization exists.

It uses Windows Forms. Feel free to yell at me for that.

## Current Features:

* Point object details
* Collision data view
* Tile data view (currently somewhat broken)
* Point object editor

## Planned Features:

* Full map view
* Range object viewer/editor
* Collision data editor

## Credits

This would not be possible without the amazing work of a few Japanese developers, in which some of whom are listed in [CREDITS.md](/CREDITS.md).

## Contributions

Any contributions are welcome, including localizations, code, and even just screenshots.
